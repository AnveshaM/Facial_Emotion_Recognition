# Facial_Emotion_Recognition
Project aimed to compare the performances of MLP, SVM and CNN algorithms in detecting the facial emotions. It also uses a pre-trained model and evaluates its performance in facial emotion recognition. The highest accuracy was achieved by the pretrained CNN model in detecting emotions.
